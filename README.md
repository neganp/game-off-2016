A game about [hacking democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering).

This is my entry for
the
[2016 Github Game Off](https://github.com/github/game-off-2016). It's
written in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) using SVG for the map and a
little CSS for styling; that's it!

There were lots of things I wanted to add (UI improvements, animation,
sound, some ideas for levels that I couldn't make work). Some of these
were hard for technical reasons, some have solutions in progress, and
some just didn't get to the top of my todo list. However, on the whole
I heartily recommend Elm for making game prototypes like this one.

Many thanks to my ever-patient partner for being patient as I
disappeared into this project on weekends and gamely being my test
audience.
